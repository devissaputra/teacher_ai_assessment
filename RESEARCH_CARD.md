# Research card: Teacher–AI Assessment Studio

## Intended use

A transparent research prototype for studying the problem described in the README, testing analytic assumptions, and preparing a future empirical study.

## Out of scope

- High-stakes grading, admissions, hiring, discipline, or personnel evaluation.
- Claims about real learners or teachers based on the bundled synthetic data.
- Replacing educator, learner, or researcher judgment with an automated score.

## Data status

Only synthetic demonstration data are bundled. Real-world use requires a documented lawful basis, informed consent where applicable, minimization, retention limits, access controls, and an appropriate ethics process.

## Evaluation standard

A future empirical version should report measurement validity, uncertainty, calibration where relevant, held-out performance, subgroup robustness, sensitivity analyses, and human-centered usefulness.

## Reproducibility

Run `scripts/reproduce.sh` from the repository root. The script compiles the package, runs the tests, regenerates the synthetic demo, and writes outputs to `results/`.

## Claim boundary

The repository demonstrates an analysis architecture and executable baseline. It does not claim a validated educational intervention or a production-ready decision system.
